# About Jason

![Selfie-By-The-Lake](../../static/img/main/selfie_by_the_lake_bw_small.jpg)

I am a Sr. Consultant working for [Microsoft](www.microsoft.com), specializing in Azure Adoption and Automation and a subject matter expert in Azure, Office 365, Exchange and PowerShell authoring as well as in the dependency areas such as Windows Server, Active Directory, network services, high availability, clustering, load balancing, disaster recovery, code review and script creation.  These skill sets have been focused in local, state, and federal agencies, but not limited to these areas.

Since 1998, I have worked in a wide variety of Information Technology roles and industries.  I joined Microsoft in January 2012 with a primary focus on Exchange, Office 365 and Active Directory where I successfully led many customers through architecture design, deployment, and migration of their messaging and identity platforms.  Today, I continue to support a large federal agency in their adoption of Windows Virtual Desktop and all thing Azure.
