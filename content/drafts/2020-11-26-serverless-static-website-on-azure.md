## First things first

> Thanks to [Matthew Fisher](https://blog.bacongobbler.com/) for his initial article and instructions.

While you don't need to be a '*coder*' or a '*developer*' to follow this article, there are a few foundational housekeeping items that we should probably clear up. The concepts and instructions in this article assume that you have a small knowledge about [Git](https://git-scm.com/), [GitHub](https://www.github.com), Microsoft Azure and [Microsoft VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/).  So before you get started, do yourself a quick favor and do the following:

- Create a **FREE** [GitHub](https://github.com/join) account
  - Github is a website for developers and programmers to collaboratively work on code. Github offers a version control system, which allows for seamless collaboration without the compromising the integrity of the original project.
- Create a **FREE** [Azure Account](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/free/)
  - Azure is the Microsoft Cloud platform. **New** accounts receive a $200 credit for the first 30 days.
- Download and install [Git](https://git-scm.com/downloads)
  - Git is an application you'll need to install on your PC or Mac. Once installed you can use the git commands from your favorite console, I prefer PowerShell. The most basic thing about git you'll need to know is the '*clone*' command. `git clone <some url.git>`
- Download and install [Microsoft VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/#alt-downloads)
- **[OPTIONAL]** Buy a custom domain name ([Namecheap](https://www.namecheap.com) is who I use)

> **WARNING!**

> I have had these tools and systems setup for a while and setting all these up from greenfield may require some bing or google-fu.
